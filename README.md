## Bugs 
- fixed bugs 
    - Issue rendering the dynamic links in the navbar when a filter was in, this was due to a conflict in variable names in the context processor for the site and the variable in the view for the all products page.
    
    - Issue with button on the banner image on index.html not submitting a filter query when pressed, button was not inside a form and therefore had nowehere to navigate too.

    - Footer wasn't generating the extra text when clicking the 'readmore...' drilled into it further with the script and adjusted the code to remove syntax errors. 

    - Amend products table wasn't showing the boolean results of if a product was 'new', fixed by amending the if statement i had used to get the correct results.

    - Couldn't upload a banner for attack on titan this was due to two seperate values of Attack on Titan being available in series choices representing two different values

    - Sizes were being delete when updating quantities in the shopping bag, fixed by adding a name to the size hidden input form in basket.html

    - search bar was disappearing from base.html on click, made the search function only available in all products as it seemed more logical for it to live in there

    - 404 returned when non-users tried to submit a review, fixed by using an if statement to only display leaving a review if you are logged in. 


## Credits 

- Code for adding products to the basket was taken from the boutique-ado walkthrough project.
